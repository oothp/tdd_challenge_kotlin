# TrueView TDD Challenge

## Task: To use TDD to implement a simple feature

The users's requirement is: 'A TrueView user needs to see what the other user loves'

For more information you can [view the presentation:](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LnKSnw1Y9fRuyf2sFaf-PrrHiJIZmn9Ajdn8kJ5Jckc/edit?usp=sharing)

## Challenge Requirements:  

- Provided a JSON with username (string) and love_key (int)
- Answer should return the user name with what they love

1. If love_key is divisible by 2, they love beer
2. If love_key is divisible by 3, they love chicken wings
3. If love_key is divisible by 2 and 3, they love TrueView

## Must Haves:

- Frame the requirements as a user story.
- Write one acceptance test based on the user story.
- Write many user tests. One for each possible scenario!
